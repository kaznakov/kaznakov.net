_Last updated: February 2026 (ScanYOmail 1.1.2)_

1. Data Controller

ScanYOmail (“we”, “us”, or “the app”) is operated by the independent developer of the ScanYOmail application.
This Privacy Policy applies to ScanYOmail version 1.1.2.

The app is currently released in an early production stage and may be available via limited distribution or public App Store access.

2. Information We Process

When you use ScanYOmail, the app may process the following types of information:

Scanned content

Images of physical letters captured using your device camera.

Basic technical image metadata (format, resolution).

Mail metadata

Letter title and category (e.g. bills, banking, government, personal, other).

Sender name or description.

Scan date and time.

Extracted values such as payment amounts and due dates (when available).

Events and reminders

Payment or deadline events created from scanned letters.

Event status (pending, overdue, completed).

Optional local notifications.

Technical session status events (for example, authenticated `401` responses) used to protect account integrity and trigger safe sign-out when a session becomes invalid.

3. What We Do Not Do

We do not sell your data.

We do not show third-party advertising.

We do not use your content for marketing or profiling.

We do not share your data with data brokers.

4. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used only to provide core app functionality, including:

Displaying scanned letters.

Extracting relevant dates and amounts.

Creating reminders and events.

Showing upcoming deadlines in the app interface.

5. OCR and AI Processing

ScanYOmail may use optical character recognition (OCR) and AI-based text analysis to extract structured information from scanned images.

Depending on configuration and availability, this processing may be performed:

Locally on the device, or

Via secure cloud-based providers (e.g. OCR or AI APIs).

If cloud processing is used:

Only the minimum required data is transmitted.

All communication is encrypted.

The data is processed solely to return extracted text or structured fields.

We may update this policy with additional provider details as the app evolves.

6. Storage and Retention

Data may be stored locally on your device or on secure servers operated by the developer.

Data is retained only as long as necessary to provide app functionality.

You may delete letters and related events at any time from within the app.

7. Security

We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect stored data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.

However, ScanYOmail is not intended as a secure document vault and should not be used as the sole storage location for sensitive documents.
